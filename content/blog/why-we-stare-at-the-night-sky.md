Every civilization before us looked up and wondered.  
The stars have always been less about navigation and more about meaning.

We stare at the night sky not to find answers, but to remember the questions.  
Who are we? Why here? Why now? The vastness above makes our everyday chaos feel smaller — not unimportant, just… contextual.

When you step outside and let your eyes adjust, there’s a brief hush inside your head.  
That’s the sound of perspective.  

Maybe that’s why we love it so much — because for a few moments, the universe feels infinite, and we feel like part of it, not trapped inside our own tiny narratives.

The stars don’t need us to look at them.  
But every time we do, they remind us how much more there is to see.

There’s a reason that second cup of coffee tastes better when you’ve earned it.  
It’s not just the caffeine — it’s the pause.

A perfect coffee break isn’t about escaping work; it’s about recalibrating your focus. When you step away, your brain quietly switches modes — from *execution* to *connection*. That’s when the good ideas sneak in.

The trick isn’t in the roast or the mug; it’s in the rhythm.  
A five-minute break too early feels like procrastination. Too late, and you’re running on fumes. But right in the middle — when your mind starts to blur — that’s where the magic happens.

The scent of coffee, the warmth of the cup, the short distance between the desk and the window — it all tells your nervous system, “Breathe, we’re still human.”

Coffee breaks aren’t productivity hacks.  
They’re proof that doing nothing, briefly and intentionally, makes everything else better.
